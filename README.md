# countdown
Count down numbers game solver. The numbers game is from a tv show called Countdown in which players use selected numbers to arrive at an answer that is picked randomly.

This is a fairly old project I started a few years ago to get familiar with Java and working with a graphical user interface. Now I am adding it here because it still works and could be fun to use.
